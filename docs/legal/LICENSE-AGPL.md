## PREAMBLE

This is the official AGPL-3.0 license for Kolibri open-source components.

**When to use this license:**
- You are contributing to open-source projects
- You are using Kolibri core algorithms
- You want to modify and share modifications
- You want to use Kolibri in network applications

**Key difference from GPL:**
- AGPL covers "network use" - if you run Software over a network, you must provide source code
- Protects against proprietary SaaS offerings that use open-source code
- Ideal for cloud/web applications

## 1. TERMS AND CONDITIONS

### 1.1 Definitions

**"This License"** refers to version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License.

**"Copyright"** also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.

**"The Program"** refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License. Each licensee is addressed as "you". **"Licensees"** and **"recipients"** may be individuals or organizations.

**"To modify"** a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy. The resulting work is called a **"modified version"** of the earlier work or a work **"based on"** the earlier work.

**"Covered work"** means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the Program.

**"Propagate"** a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.

**"Convey"** a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer network, without transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

**"Interactive User Interface"** displays "Appropriate Legal Notices" to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.

---

## 2. SOURCE CODE

### 2.1 Definition

The **"source code"** for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. **"Object code"** means any non-source form of a work.

The **"Standard Interface"** of a library is the set of application programming interfaces (APIs) whose names, calling conventions and return types are all declared in header files supplied with the library.

A library is a collection of software functions and/or data prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.

### 2.2 Exception for Specific Libraries

If you convey object code work under this license, you must also provide the source code of the work. The source code for the Program means the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable.

---

## 3. COPYING

You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without conditions, so long as your license otherwise remains in force. You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running these works, provided that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not control copyright.

**Those thus making or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.**

---

## 4. NETWORK INTERACTION (AGPL Key Feature)

If the Software is deployed such that its features are accessed through a network (including but not limited to the Internet), you must provide a means for users to receive a copy of the source code.

**In particular:**

If the program as normally used invokes an interactive feature that displays information, the corresponding source code should include information accessible to the user both ways - either in an interface that shows the source to users, as a practical matter, or through some other standard means.

**For AGPL specifically:**

Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to link or combine the Program with a library (or a work based on it) covered by the LGPL (Lesser General Public License) under section 3 of the LGPL.

### 4.1 Remote Network Interaction

If you modify the Program, your modified version must prominently offer all users interacting with it remotely through a computer network (if your version supports such interaction) an opportunity to receive the Corresponding Source of your version by providing access to the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge, through some standard or customary means of facilitating copying of software.

**This means:** If you run Kolibri as a SaaS (Software-as-a-Service) and users access it over the network, you must make the source code available to users upon request.

---

## 5. TERM AND TERMINATION

This license is perpetual unless terminated. Your license is automatically revoked if you:

1. Violate any term of this License (not cured within 30 days)
2. Initiate patent litigation against anyone for patent infringement
3. Claim that the Software infringes your patents

Upon termination:
- Your rights under this License cease
- You must stop using and distributing the Software
- But recipients who obtained copies from you retain their rights

---

## 6. CONVEYING MODIFIED VERSIONS

### 6.1 Conditions

If you convey a modified version of the Program, you must:

1. **License the work** under this License (AGPL v3 or any later version)
2. **Provide source code** in machine-readable form
3. **Display prominent notices** stating modifications were made and their dates
4. **License any new material** under this License
5. **Inform recipients** how to get the source code

### 6.2 Modified Versions Must Be Distributed

You may not convey a covered work unless you also convey the Corresponding Source under the terms of this License.

The **"Corresponding Source"** for a work in object code form means all the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities.

---

## 7. ADDITIONAL PERMISSIONS

You may add additional permissions to material, where conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License. You may act only under your own authority, not on behalf of any other party, and only if you agree that you will indemnify each of the other licensees for any liability incurred by them as a result of this additional permission.

If the Program as you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice saying it is governed by this License "or any later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

---

## 8. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY

**THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND**, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

IN NO EVENT SHALL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES, including any general, special, incidental or consequential damages arising out of the use or inability to use the Program.

---

## 9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

IN NO EVENT SHALL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM, EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

---

## 10. INTERPRETATION

Nothing in this License is intended to limit any right you have as a user of the Software under fair use or similar doctrines, or any other applicable law, even if the License is deemed to supersede it.
